# Victoria I
Victoria I (1691 - 1809) was Queen of Willow Creek from 1697 to her abdication in 1800. She was born in 1691, being the child of Queen Anne I (1653-1697) and Prince London (1648-1722). The reign of Victoria was the longest reign from 1770 to 2420, her record being surpassed by [Mary III] (2297-2421).

## Reign (1697 - 1800)
Victoria ascended to the throne in 1697 following the death of her mother, Queen Anne. A regency council was established under Victoria up until her marriage to Damon in 1704.

### Jubilees
Victoria became the first monarch since Queen Louise II (1601-1674) in 1657 to celebrate a silver jubilee in honor of 25 years of her service in 1722. Victoria celebrated a Ruby jubilee in honor of 40 years of her service in 1737, a celebration that has not been seen since 2672.

Victoria later celebrated a Golden jubilee in 1747 in honor of 50 years of her service, a celebration that has not been seen since 1574 for [Oscar I] (1502-1597). She then celebrated a Diamond jubilee in 1757 for 60 years of service, and later a Platinum jubilee in 1767 for 70 years of service.

Victoria then surpassed expectations by celebrating a Oak Jubilee in 1777 for 80 years of service, then a Granite Jubilee in 1787 for 90 years of service.

Victoria then celebrated a Jadeite jubilee in 1797 for 100 years of service, which was the last jubilee she would celebrate before her abdication in 1800.

## Marriage (1704 - 1781)
In 1704, Victoria and Damon (1686-1781) would marry in a lavish and luxurious wedding ceremony. The couple would spend the next 75 years together. The couple celebrated all jubilee celebrations and anniversaries together. The last jubilee celebration that the couple was together for was Victoria's Oak Jubilee, held in 1777. The last anniversary celebration was held in 1779 for 75 years of marriage.

Their marriage would eventually come naturally to its end in 1781 when Damon passed away at the age of 95.

## Later Life
Victoria became the oldest monarch in the history of Willow Creek after surpassing the record of [Oscar I] in 1786. She became known for her longevity and health.

### Centenarian & Abdication
Victoria would become a Centernarian in 1791. Her age began to be questioned heavily to the point of no return in 1795. Parliament was heavily questioning her rule as she reached the age of 105. She decided to step down from her duties and responsibilites as Queen in 1800.

### Supercentenarian
Victoria later turned 110 in 1801, making her a supercentenarian. She publicly stated that abdicating was a peaceful way of resolving the tension in Parliament. However, her abdication eventually led to Parliament dissolving the monarchy in 1802 and executing George IV.

## Death
Victoria passed away in 1809 at the age of 118.
