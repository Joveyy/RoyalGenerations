# Trilogies
As of **June 2nd, 2025** there are currently **two** trilogies either planned or currently being worked on.

## Original
This trilogy began on **August 31st, 2023** with the year system being set to begin at 1290. The trilogy begins with Dustin I reigning, and eventually gets over 2000 years of history.

The year system goes up by 1 year (12 months) every in-game day.

## Prequels
This trilogy is set to begin in **2025** with the year system set thousands of years before the events of the Original Trilogy. The trilogy is expected to begin with the idea of a medevidal style of ruling, either as a republic or a monarchy. The trilogy is expected to conclude when the year system reaches 1272, when Dustin I is born.

This trilogy officially started on **June 3rd, 2025** with the year system set at **1272 BC**, the year system goes up by 6 months every in-game day.

This year system was later updated after reaching the end of the 1200s BC, so now it goes up by 1 year (12 months) every in-game day.
